## Use SQLite Database Sample

The sample illustrates the use of the SQLite databases using *SleepingBearSystems.Tools.Persistence.Sqlite*
library.  The sample program creates two SQLite databases using the *SqliteDatabase* and 
*TemporaryDatabaseGuard* classes, writes some data to the databases, and then reads it back.
