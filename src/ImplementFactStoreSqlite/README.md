## Implement FactStore SQLite

The sample illustrates the use of the versioned SQLite databases using *SleepingBearSystems.Tools.Persistence.Sqlite*
library. The sample program creates an SQLite database *TemporaryDatabaseGuard* class, versions it,
and then uses the database as a simple fact store for event sourcing.
